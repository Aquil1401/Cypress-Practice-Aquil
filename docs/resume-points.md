# Resume Points – Cypress Automation Framework (JavaScript)

- Built a scalable **Cypress automation framework** using **Page Object Model (POM)** with JavaScript.
- Designed a clean separation of **tests, page objects, locators, fixtures, and configuration** for long-term maintainability.
- Implemented **environment-based configuration** to securely manage sensitive data like credentials and URLs.
- Utilized **Cypress fixtures** to manage non-sensitive test data such as expected UI text, error messages, and configuration values.
- Wrote **business-level assertions** instead of basic UI checks to validate real application behavior.
- Reduced flaky tests by leveraging **Cypress automatic waiting** and stable locator strategies.
- Enabled **screenshots on failure** and **video recording in headless runs** to improve debugging and CI visibility.
- Designed reusable page object methods and clean test flows using `beforeEach` hooks.
- Created **interview-ready documentation** covering framework architecture, best practices, and mock interview Q&A.
- Ensured the framework is **CI-ready and scalable** for real-world automation projects.
